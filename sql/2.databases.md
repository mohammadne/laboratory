# Database

actually we have our my-sql database server that's running on our local machine (mysql-ctl start)

a server can contain multiple datatbases for different applications, which are independent

## show all databases your mySQL server

- SHOW DATABASES;

## creating databases

- CREATE DATABASE <db_name>;

recommandation: use all lower-case with underscore chars for names, you don't have to use uppercase characters in sql-commands but it's a good practice for SQL.

## delete database

- DROP DATABASE <db_name>;

## use database

- USE <db_name>;

because for ex, you want to search in a database

## show the database we are using currently

- SELECT DATABASE();
- select current_database();

if you don't selected a DB, it will show you null for selected DB.

### what NULL means ?

it says the value is not known(not mean zero!!!).
