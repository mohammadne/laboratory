# Aggregate Functions

bulit in SQL functions that allows for aggregation or combination of data to get meaning of it

``` sql
SET GLOBAL sql_mode=(SELECT REPLACE(@@sql_mode,'ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY',''));

SET SESSION sql_mode=(SELECT REPLACE(@@sql_mode,'ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY',''));

-- When MySQL's only_full_group_by mode is turned on,
-- it means that strict ANSI SQL rules will apply when using aggreagte functions like: GROUP BY.

-- With regard to your query, this means that if you GROUP BY of the author_lname column,
-- then you can only select two things:
-- 1- the author_lname column
-- 2- aggregates of any other column
```

The vast majority of MySQL GROUP BY questions which I see on so far, have strict mode turned off, so the query is running, but with incorrect results. In your case, the query won't run at all, forcing you to think about what you really want to do.

## COUNT

``` sql
SELECT COUNT (*) AS count FROM <table_name>;
```

- focus that COUNT(*) means counts in each row

ex: count whatever to count like how many books we have?

## GROUP BY

group together based on given statement or summerized and aggregates identical data into single rows.

it will create a super row and preview the first one

``` sql
SELECT <column_1>, <column_2> FROM <table_name> GROUP BY <column_name>
```

- a common task is to use it along side of other aggregate functions like COUNT

- COUNT(*) means counts in each super row

ex: group movies by their genre and if there are 3 genre, it will return 3 super group each one for a genre.

## MIN, MAX

min or max value in a table

``` sql
SELECT MAX(<column_name>) FROM <table_name>;
```

ex: find minimum released_year in our books.
ex: show the title of maximum book which have max pages
focus about if we give another column with MAX or MIN, the result may be irrelevent.

## SUM

adds things together

``` sql
SELECT SUM(<column_name>) FROM <table_name>;
```

ex: sum all pages in entire database

## AVG

average the data and it's precision is 4 points.

``` sql
SELECT AVG(<column_name>) FROM <table_name>;
```

ex: average sales of monthes.
