# Relationship

## One to One relationship (one:one)

ex: user and its email or password or user's details

## One to Many relationship (one:many)

- most common relationship

ex: each book in amazon has lots of reviews,
each book can have multiple reviews,
each review belongs to only one book.

- question: we want to store our customers and their orders

- a1: use one table, on each row store user with its order in a gaint table
- disadvantage1: suppose a user has 20 orders, on each order, we duplicate user data
and we occupy a huge space for user information
- disadvantage2: if a user register to our site recently, he has no any order
so we have to occupy a null space for its order

- a2: use two tables with one:many relationship
in this answer, we should add another column into orders named customer_id (forign key)
we do not use normal integers for customer_id because there is no limit to stopping
us from associating wrong id for it, foreign key add some constraint for us.

## Many to Many relationShip (many:many)

ex: suppose books and authors entities,
each book can have multiple authors,
each author can have multiple books.
