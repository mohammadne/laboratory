# Healtch Checks

- if application is malfunction, it's possible that pods are still running and will not restart.

- we should always expose health check to outside to check availability and resiliency of the app.

- we have 2 type of health checks:

  - `command`: running a command in the container periodically.

  - `URL`: periodic checks on a URL.

## livenessProbes

> indicate whether a container is running

- if check fails, the container will be restarted

## readinessProbes

> indicates whether at the startup, the pod only recieve traffic when the tests succeeds

- if the check fails, the container will not be restarted, but the Pod's IP address will be removed from the service, so it'll not serve any requests more.

- the pod will be ready only after readinessProbe sucess signal.
