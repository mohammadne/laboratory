# Service

- pods are dynamic, means they can come and terminated in the cluster for example when using RC, pods are terminated and created during scaling operations

- when using Deployments, when updating the image version, pods are terminate and new pods take the place of older pods.

- so pods should be accessed via a service

- `service` is the logical-bridge between the pods and other services or end-users

- creating a service will create an endpoint for your pod(s):

  - `ClusterIp`: virtual Ip reachable inside the cluster

  - `NodePort`: a port that is the same on each node that is also reachable externally

  - `LoadBalancer`: created by cloud-provider that will route external traffic to every node on the NodePort (ELB on AWS)

- there is also possibility to use `DNS names`:

  - external-name can provide a DNS name for the service like service discovery useing DNS.

  - only works when `DNS add-on` is enabled

- by default service can only run between ports 30000-32767 but you could change this behavior by addng the --service-node-port-range argument to the `kube-apiserver` (init script of master node)

- service will automatically assign a random port to the NodePort but you can assign port manually by `nodePort` option (handle collisions manually).

- we shoukd use selector in in service to filter and reach appropriate pods.
