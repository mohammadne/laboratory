# Table

## Create table

``` sql
CREATE TABLE <table_name>(<column_1_name> <data_type>, <column_2_name> <data_type>);
```

## delete table

``` sql
DROP TABLE <table_name>
```

## show and describe table columns

``` sql
SHOW COLUMNS FROM <table_name>;
DESC <table_name>;
```

the third column is Null COLUMN, if column's values are yes, it means if you try to insert a row with missing any column value, it will be null.

## see all the data of a table

``` sql
SELECT * FROM <table_name>;
```

## show table warnings after any crud operation

``` sql
SHOW WARNINGS;
```

if we try to insert a string more than max varchar chars, we will recieve a warning, but you will see row affected. for example in this case, the rest of the string will be gone. another example is to insert string into an int column which become 0.

after you see the data of warnings, the warnings will be gone.

## Create table with not null and default column

``` sql
CREATE TABLE <table_name>(<column_1_name> <data_type> NOT NULL, <column_2_name> <data_type> DEFAULT <default_value>, <column_3_name> <data_type> NOT NULL <default_value>);
```

if try to insert null values into a non-null column, it will try to use the default value and if default value is NULL, then it will assign zero value of that type into the missing column.

as a side note, you can store NULL value directly into a column but focus that if you try to dirrectly assign a NULL value into a non-null column, you will get an error and it's not permitted.

## important focus

use double quotes for table_names, column_name and ... which are upper case, have space between them and so on and also for texts use single quotes.
